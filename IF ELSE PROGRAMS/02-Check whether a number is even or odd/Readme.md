## Description
This program determines whether a given integer is even or odd. It takes user input and uses the modulus operator `%` to check if the number is divisible by 2. The program then outputs whether the number is "even" or "odd."

## Features
- Prompts the user to enter an integer.
- Uses the modulus operator to check divisibility by 2.
- Prints a clear message indicating if the number is even or odd.
- Simple and easy-to-understand code ideal for beginners.

## How It Works
- The program uses `printf` to request a number input from the user.
- `scanf` reads the entered integer and stores it in a variable.
- The modulus operator `%` calculates the remainder when divided by 2.
- If the remainder is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd.
- The result is printed accordingly.
