## Author

## Description
This program calculates the absolute value of a given integer. It prompts the user to enter a number and then determines its absolute value by checking if the number is negative or positive. The program demonstrates basic conditional statements and input/output handling in C.

## Features
- Takes integer input from the user.
- Calculates the absolute value without using the built-in `abs()` function.
- Prints the absolute value as a non-negative number.
- Uses simple, beginner-friendly logic.

## How It Works
- The user is prompted to enter any integer.
- The program checks if the number is less than zero.
  - If yes, it multiplies the number by -1 to return a positive value.
  - Otherwise, it returns the number itself.
- The absolute value is then printed.
