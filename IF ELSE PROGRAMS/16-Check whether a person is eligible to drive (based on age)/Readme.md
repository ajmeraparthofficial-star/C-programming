## Author

## Description
This C program determines if a person is eligible to drive based on their age. The program prompts the user to enter their age and checks if it meets the legal driving age criteria. It uses the standard input/output library (`stdio.h`) for interaction with the user.

## Features
- Takes the user's age as input.
- Checks if the age is 18 or above.
- Prints a message indicating whether the person is eligible to drive.
- Simple, beginner-friendly program demonstrating conditional statements.

## How It Works
- The program uses `printf` to request the user's age.
- `scanf` reads the age input.
- An `if-else` condition compares the age:
  - If age is 18 or more, prints "You are eligible to drive."
  - Otherwise, prints "You are not eligible to drive."
