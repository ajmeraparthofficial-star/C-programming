## Description
This C program calculates the electricity bill based on the number of units consumed entered by the user. It uses simple input and output statements from the standard input-output library (`stdio.h`). The program applies a tiered tariff system to compute the total bill amount depending on the units consumed.

## Features
- Takes the number of electricity units consumed as input.
- Calculates the total bill based on slab-wise rates.
- Displays the bill amount clearly.
- Simple to understand and useful for beginners learning C programming and conditional logic.

## Tariff Rates (Example)
- For the first 100 units: ₹5 per unit
- For the next 100 units (101-200): ₹7 per unit
- For units above 200: ₹10 per unit

> Note: You may adjust rates according to your local electricity provider.

## How It Works
- The program prompts the user to enter the number of units consumed.
- It calculates the bill by applying the corresponding rates slab-wise.
- Prints the total electricity bill amount.
