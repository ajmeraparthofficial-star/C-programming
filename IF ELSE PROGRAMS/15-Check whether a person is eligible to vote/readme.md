## Description
This simple C program determines if a person is eligible to vote based on their age. It prompts the user to enter their age and checks whether it is 18 or above, which is the legal voting age in many countries. The program uses basic input/output functions and conditional statements in C.

## Features
- Takes the user's age as input.
- Checks if the age is 18 or older for voting eligibility.
- Displays a clear message indicating if the person can vote or not.
- Simple and beginner-friendly code using only the standard input/output library.

## How It Works
- The program prompts the user to enter their age.
- It reads the input using `scanf`.
- Then it uses an `if-else` condition to check if the age is at least 18.
- If yes, it prints "You are eligible to vote."
- Otherwise, it prints "You are not eligible to vote."
