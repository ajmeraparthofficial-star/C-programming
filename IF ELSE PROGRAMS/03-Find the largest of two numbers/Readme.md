## Author

## Description
This program takes two integer inputs from the user and determines which one is larger. It demonstrates the use of basic input/output functions and conditional statements (`if-else`) in C programming.

## Features
- Prompts the user to enter two integers.
- Compares the two numbers to find the largest.
- Displays which number is larger or if both are equal.
- Simple logic suitable for beginners learning decision making in C.

## How It Works
- The program asks the user to input two numbers using `printf` and `scanf`.
- Uses `if-else` statements to compare the numbers:
  - If the first number is greater, it prints that number is the largest.
  - If the second number is greater, it prints that number is the largest.
  - If both numbers are equal, it prints a message indicating equality.
