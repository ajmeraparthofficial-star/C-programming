# Check Whether a Character is an Alphabet or Not

**Author:** Parth Ajmera

## Description
This C program checks if a user-entered character is an alphabet letter (either uppercase or lowercase). It leverages ASCII values to determine whether the input is between 'A' to 'Z' or 'a' to 'z' and then displays an appropriate message.

## Features
- Prompts the user to enter a single character.
- Evaluates if the entered character is an alphabet (A-Z or a-z).
- Prints a message indicating whether the character is an alphabet or not.
- Beginner-friendly and useful for understanding character handling and conditional statements in C.

## How It Works
- The program takes a character input using `scanf`.
- It checks if the ASCII value of the character falls in the ranges for uppercase ('A' - 'Z') or lowercase ('a' - 'z') alphabets.
- If yes, it prints that the character is an alphabet.
- Otherwise, it prints that the character is not an alphabet.
