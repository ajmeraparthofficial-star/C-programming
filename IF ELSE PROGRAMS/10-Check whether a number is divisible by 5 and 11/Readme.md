## Description
This C program checks if a given integer is divisible by both 5 and 11. The program prompts the user to enter a number, then uses the modulo operator to test divisibility by 5 and 11. It displays a message indicating whether the number meets the divisibility criteria.

## Features
- Takes an integer input from the user.
- Checks divisibility by both 5 and 11 using conditional statements.
- Provides clear output messages for divisible and non-divisible cases.
- Simple structure ideal for beginners learning conditional logic.

## How It Works
- The user is prompted to enter a number.
- The program uses the `%` (modulo) operator to compute the remainder of the number divided by 5 and 11.
- If both remainders are zero, the number is divisible by 5 and 11.
- Appropriate messages are printed based on the result.
