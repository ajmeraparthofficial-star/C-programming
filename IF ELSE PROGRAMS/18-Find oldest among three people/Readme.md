## Description
This C program determines the oldest person among three individuals based on their ages. Using only standard input/output functions from `stdio.h`, it prompts the user to enter the ages of three people, compares them, and prints the oldest age along with a message.

## Features
- Takes age inputs for three people.
- Uses simple conditional statements (`if-else`) to find the oldest.
- Displays the oldest age along with appropriate output.
- Lightweight and suitable for beginners learning decision-making in C.

## How It Works
- The program first prompts the user to enter age values for three individuals.
- It compares the ages using conditional statements.
- It checks:
  - If the first person’s age is greater than or equal to both the second and third.
  - Else if the second person’s age is greater than or equal to both the others.
  - Otherwise, the third person is the oldest.
- Prints the oldest person's age.
