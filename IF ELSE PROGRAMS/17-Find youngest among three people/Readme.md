## Description
This C program determines the youngest person among three based on the ages entered by the user. It uses only the standard input-output library `stdio.h` and simple conditional statements to compare the ages and print the result.

## Features
- Prompts the user to enter the ages of three individuals.
- Compares the ages using conditional statements.
- Prints the name or position of the youngest person.
- Handles cases where two or more people have the same age.

## How It Works
1. The program asks the user to input the age of three people.
2. It compares the ages using `if-else` statements.
3. If one person is strictly youngest, it outputs that person.
4. If there is a tie for youngest, it can print multiple names or handle accordingly.
