# Check Whether a Triangle is Valid or Not (Sum of Angles = 180Â°)

## Description
This C program takes three angles as input and checks whether they form a valid triangle based on the angle sum property. A triangle is valid if the sum of its three interior angles is exactly 180 degrees, and each angle is greater than zero.

The program uses standard input/output functions from `stdio.h` and simple conditional checks to determine the validity.

## Features
- Reads three angles from the user.
- Checks if the sum of the angles equals 180.
- Ensures all angles are positive and non-zero.
- Displays whether the triangle is valid or not.

## How It Works
- The user is prompted to enter three angles.
- The program calculates the sum of the three angles.
- If the sum is 180 and all angles are greater than zero, it prints "Triangle is valid."
- Otherwise, it prints "Triangle is not valid."
