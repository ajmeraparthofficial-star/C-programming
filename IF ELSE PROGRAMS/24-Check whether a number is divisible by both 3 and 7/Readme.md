# Check Divisibility by Both 3 and 7 in C

## Author

## Description
This C program checks whether a user-entered integer is divisible by both 3 and 7. The program uses simple arithmetic and conditional statements to determine divisibility and prints an appropriate message.

## Features
- Takes an integer input from the user.
- Checks divisibility by 3 and 7 using the modulo operator `%`.
- Prints whether the number is divisible by both 3 and 7 or not.
- Uses only the standard input/output library (`stdio.h`).
- Ideal for beginners learning conditional logic and arithmetic operations.

## How It Works
- The program prompts the user to enter a number.
- It reads the number using `scanf`.
- It uses the modulo operator `%` to check if the number leaves no remainder when divided by both 3 and 7.
- If both conditions are met, it prints that the number is divisible by both; otherwise, it prints it is not.
