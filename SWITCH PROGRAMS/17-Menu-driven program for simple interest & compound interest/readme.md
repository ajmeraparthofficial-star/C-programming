# Menu-Driven Program for Simple Interest & Compound Interest

## Author

## Description
This C program calculates simple interest and compound interest based on the user's choice in a menu-driven interface. It uses standard input/output functions from `stdio.h` and implements the menu using a `switch` statement to select the desired calculation. The program demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and control flow in C.

## Features
- Menu-driven interface to choose between Simple Interest and Compound Interest calculations.
- Input for principal amount, rate of interest, and time period.
- Calculates and displays the interest and total amount accordingly.
- Uses `switch` for clean and efficient menu handling.
- Suitable for beginners learning conditional statements and basic financial formulas.

## How It Works
- The user is presented with a menu to choose the interest type.
- Based on the choice entered, the program reads the principal, rate, and time values.
- For simple interest, formula used is:  
  **Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100**
- For compound interest, formula used is:  
  **Compound Interest = Principal × ( (1 + Rate/100)^Time - 1 )**
- The program outputs the calculated interest and the total amount (principal + interest).

## Code To Do It Using Pow fn--
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h> // Note: math.h is required for pow function in compound interest calculation

int main() {
    int choice;
    double principal, rate, time;
    double interest, total_amount;

    printf("Interest Calculator Menu:\n");
    printf("1. Simple Interest\n");
    printf("2. Compound Interest\n");
    printf("Enter your choice (1 or 2): ");
    scanf("%d", &choice);

    if (choice != 1 && choice != 2) {
        printf("Invalid choice! Please select 1 or 2.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Enter principal amount: ");
    scanf("%lf", &principal);
    if (principal <= 0) {
        printf("Principal amount must be positive.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Enter rate of interest (in %%): ");
    scanf("%lf", &rate);
    if (rate <= 0) {
        printf("Rate of interest must be positive.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Enter time period (in years): ");
    scanf("%lf", &time);
    if (time <= 0) {
        printf("Time period must be positive.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    switch (choice) {
        case 1: // Simple Interest
            interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100.0;
            total_amount = principal + interest;
            printf("Simple Interest = %.2lf\n", interest);
            printf("Total Amount = %.2lf\n", total_amount);
            break;

        case 2: // Compound Interest
            interest = principal * (pow((1 + rate / 100.0), time) - 1);
            total_amount = principal + interest;
            printf("Compound Interest = %.2lf\n", interest);
            printf("Total Amount = %.2lf\n", total_amount);
            break;

        default:
            printf("Invalid choice.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
