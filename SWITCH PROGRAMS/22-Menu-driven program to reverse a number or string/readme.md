# Menu-Driven Program to Reverse a Number or String in C

## Author

## Description
This C program provides a menu-driven interface to reverse either a number or a string based on user choice. Using only the standard input/output library (`stdio.h`) and the `switch` statement, it demonstrates fundamental concepts of control flow and string/number manipulation in C.

## Features
- Presents a menu to the user with options to reverse a number or a string.
- Takes input from the user based on the selected option.
- Uses loops and conditional logic within the `switch` case to perform the reversal.
- Displays the reversed output.
- Simple and beginner-friendly structure.

## How It Works
- The program displays a menu with choices:
  - Reverse a number
  - Reverse a string
  - Exit
- Based on user input, a `switch` statement directs the flow to the appropriate reversal logic.
- For number reversal, the program extracts digits and constructs the reversed number.
- For string reversal, it reverses characters in the string.
- The program loops until the user chooses to exit.
