# Simple Calculator in C

## Author

## Description
This program is a simple calculator implemented in C language using only the standard input/output library (`stdio.h`) and a `switch` statement. It performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on the user's choice.

## Features
- Prompts the user to select an arithmetic operation: `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`.
- Takes two numeric inputs from the user.
- Uses a `switch` statement to perform the selected operation.
- Handles invalid operation inputs gracefully.
- Outputs the result of the calculation.

## How It Works
- The program first asks the user to input an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- Then it asks for two integers as operands.
- The `switch` statement evaluates the operator and executes the corresponding case to perform the operation.
- If the operator is not one of the valid symbols, it displays an error message.
