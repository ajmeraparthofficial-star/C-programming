# Menu-Driven Program: Factorial, Fibonacci, and Prime Check

## Author

## Description
This C program provides a menu-driven interface allowing users to choose between calculating the factorial of a number, generating Fibonacci series, or checking if a number is prime. The program uses only the standard input/output header (`stdio.h`) and a `switch` statement for menu selection, making it simple yet effective for learning conditional branching and loops.

## Features
- Displays a menu to the user with options to:
  - Calculate factorial of a number.
  - Generate Fibonacci series up to a given number of terms.
  - Check if a number is prime.
- Uses `switch` statement for choice handling.
- Accepts user input for each operation and displays the results.
- Clear and beginner-friendly structure without external libraries.

## How It Works
- The program repeatedly shows a menu to the user until the user chooses to exit.
- Based on user's choice, it performs the desired calculation:
  - Factorial: Uses a loop to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer.
  - Fibonacci: Prints Fibonacci sequence for the specified number of terms.
  - Prime Check: Tests divisibility to determine if a number is prime.
- The `switch` statement handles menu options efficiently.
