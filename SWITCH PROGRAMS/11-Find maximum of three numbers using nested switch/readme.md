# Find Maximum of Three Numbers Using Nested Switch in C

## Author

## Description
This C program finds the maximum of three numbers using nested `switch` statements. It takes three integer inputs from the user and compares them using nested `switch` cases to determine the largest number. The program uses only standard input/output (`stdio.h`) and the `switch` control structure, demonstrating an unconventional but effective approach to comparison.

## Features
- Accepts three integers as inputs.
- Uses nested `switch` statements to determine the maximum number.
- Prints the maximum number to the console.
- Avoids usage of `if-else` statements, focusing on `switch` for logic flow.
- Provides a clear demonstration of nested switch usage in C.

## How It Works
- The program reads three numbers entered by the user.
- It compares the numbers by evaluating expressions inside the `switch` statements that return `0` or `1`.
- Nested `switch` cases handle different comparison results to identify the maximum.
- Finally, it prints the largest number found.
