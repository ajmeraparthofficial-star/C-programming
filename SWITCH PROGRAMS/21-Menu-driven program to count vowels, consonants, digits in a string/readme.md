## Description
This C program performs a menu-driven operation to count the number of vowels, consonants, and digits in a user-provided string. It uses basic input/output functions from `stdio.h` and employs the `switch` statement to categorize characters effectively. The program is designed to be simple yet demonstrates how to use menu-driven logic and character analysis in C.

## Features
- Accepts a string input from the user.
- Displays a menu to select counting vowels, consonants, or digits.
- Uses `switch` statements for character classification.
- Provides accurate counts based on user selection.
- Illustrates fundamental programming concepts suitable for beginners.

## How It Works
- The program prompts the user to input a string.
- It displays a menu to choose the type of counting:
  - Count vowels
  - Count consonants
  - Count digits
- Based on the userâ€™s choice, it iterates over the string.
- Each character is evaluated using a `switch` to determine its category.
- Finally, the count is displayed accordingly.
