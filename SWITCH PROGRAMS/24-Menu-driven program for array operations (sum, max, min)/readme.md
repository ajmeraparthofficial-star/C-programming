# Menu-Driven Program for Array Operations in C

## Author

## Description
This C program performs basic operations on an array using a menu-driven approach. It allows the user to choose between calculating the sum, finding the maximum, or finding the minimum value in the array. The program demonstrates the use of arrays, `switch` statements, and basic input/output functions from `stdio.h`.

## Features
- Input an array of integers from the user.
- Menu options to:
  - Calculate the sum of all array elements.
  - Find the maximum element.
  - Find the minimum element.
- Looping menu to perform multiple operations without restarting the program.
- Simple and clear control flow using `switch` statement.

## How It Works
1. The program first asks the user to input the size of the array and then the elements.
2. It displays a menu with options to calculate sum, max, min, or exit.
3. Based on the user's choice, it performs the respective operation using array traversal.
4. Results are displayed, and the menu prompts for the next choice until exit is selected.
