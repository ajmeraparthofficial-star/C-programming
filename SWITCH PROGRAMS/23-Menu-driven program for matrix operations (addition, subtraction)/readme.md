# Menu-Driven Program for Matrix Operations (Addition, Subtraction)

## Author
Parth Ajmera

## Description
This C program performs basic matrix operations such as addition and subtraction using a menu-driven approach. The user can choose the desired operation from the menu. The program uses only the standard input-output library (`stdio.h`) and the `switch` statement for flow control.

## Features
- Menu-driven interface for user-friendly operation selection.
- Supports addition and subtraction of two matrices.
- Takes matrix dimensions and elements as input from the user.
- Displays the resulting matrix after the selected operation.
- Handles matrices of any size as specified by the user.

## How It Works
- The program repeatedly displays a menu with options to add, subtract matrices, or exit.
- Depending on the userâ€™s choice, the corresponding matrix operation is performed.
- Input matrices are read from the user using `scanf`.
- Matrix addition and subtraction are done element-wise.
- Results are displayed using `printf`.
