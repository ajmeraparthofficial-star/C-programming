# Menu-Driven Program for Arithmetic Operations in C

## Author
Parth Ajmera

## Description
This C program provides a menu-driven interface for performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. It uses only the standard input/output library (`stdio.h`) and the `switch` statement for operation selection, making it simple and efficient.

## Features
- Interactive menu for users to choose arithmetic operations.
- Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).
- Uses `switch` case for control flow.
- Handles user inputs and performs calculations accordingly.
- Includes basic validation for division by zero.

## How It Works
- The program displays a menu listing the arithmetic operations.
- The user inputs a choice corresponding to an operation.
- The program prompts for two integers.
- Using a `switch` statement, the selected operation is performed.
- The result is displayed to the user.
- The program can be designed to loop back to the menu, allowing multiple calculations (optional).
