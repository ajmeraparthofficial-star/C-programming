# Menu-driven Program: Area of Circle, Rectangle, Triangle

## Author

## Description
This C program calculates the area of three different shapes: Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. It uses a menu-driven approach where the user selects the shape for which they want to calculate the area. The program demonstrates the use of `switch` statements and basic input/output functions from the `stdio.h` library.

## Features
- Displays a menu to choose the shape: Circle, Rectangle, or Triangle.
- Accepts user input for dimensions (radius, length, breadth, base, and height).
- Calculates and displays the area of the selected shape.
- Employs a `switch` case for menu selection.
- Simple, beginner-friendly code.

## How It Works
1. The program displays a menu with options for Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle.
2. The user enters their choice.
3. Based on the selection, the program prompts for the necessary inputs.
4. The program calculates the area using the respective formula:
   - Circle: \( \pi \times radius^2 \)
   - Rectangle: \( length \times breadth \)
   - Triangle: \( \frac{1}{2} \times base \times height \)
5. Finally, it displays the computed area.
