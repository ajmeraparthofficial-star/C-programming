## Description
This C program prints the multiplication table of a number entered by the user. The program utilizes standard input/output functions from `stdio.h` and employs a `switch` statement to control the flow. It prints the table from 1 to 10 for the given number.

## Features
- Prompts the user to enter an integer.
- Prints the multiplication table for the entered number from 1 to 10.
- Uses a `switch` statement to handle the multiplication table generation process.
- Simple and beginner-friendly.

## How It Works
- The program first takes an input number from the user.
- Using a `switch` statement (typically combined with loops or repeated cases), the program prints the multiples of the entered number.
- It iterates through the numbers 1 to 10 and prints the product of the input number and the iterator.
- This approach helps in learning both input/output and control flow using `switch`.
