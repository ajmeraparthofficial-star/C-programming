## Description
This C program calculates the sum of squares of the first N natural numbers entered by the user. It utilizes simple loops and standard input-output functions from `stdio.h` to compute the result efficiently. This program is ideal for beginners to practice loops and basic arithmetic operations in C.

## Features
- Takes a positive integer N as input from the user.
- Uses a loop to calculate the sum of squares from 1 to N.
- Prints the calculated sum.
- Written using only standard I/O functions and loops.

## How It Works
- The program prompts the user to enter the value of N.
- A loop runs from 1 to N, squaring each number and adding it to a running total.
- After the loop ends, the total sum of squares is printed.
