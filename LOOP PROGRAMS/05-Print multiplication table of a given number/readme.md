## Author

## Description
This program prints the multiplication table of a number provided by the user. It uses only the standard input-output library (`stdio.h`) and loop constructs to generate the table from 1 to 10. This program is a great exercise for beginners to practice loops and basic C programming concepts.

## Features
- Prompts the user to enter an integer.
- Prints the multiplication table for the entered number from 1 to 10.
- Uses a loop for concise and clear logic.
- Minimal dependencies; uses only `<stdio.h>`.

## How It Works
1. The user is asked to input a number.
2. A `for` loop iterates from 1 to 10.
3. In every iteration, the program calculates and prints the product of the entered number and the loop counter.
4. The output displays a formatted multiplication table.
