# Print Even Numbers from 1 to 100

## Description
This C program prints all even numbers from 1 to 100 using standard input/output and loop constructs. The program demonstrates the use of loops and conditional statements to filter and display even numbers within a specified range.

## Features
- Uses only `stdio.h` for input/output operations.
- Employs a loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 100.
- Checks each number to determine if it is even.
- Prints all even numbers in the range in a clear format.
- Simple and beginner-friendly approach to loops and conditionals.

## How It Works
- The program uses a `for` loop to traverse numbers 1 through 100.
- Each number is checked using the modulus operator `%` to determine if it is divisible by 2.
- If the number is even (i.e., remainder when divided by 2 is zero), it is printed.
- The process repeats until all numbers in the range have been evaluated.
