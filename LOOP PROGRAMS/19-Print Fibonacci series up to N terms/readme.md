# Print Fibonacci Series up to N Terms Using Loops

## Author

## Description
This C program prints the Fibonacci series up to **N** terms. The program uses only the standard input/output library (`stdio.h`) and loops to generate the Fibonacci sequence. It demonstrates the use of basic loop constructs and variable manipulation to produce the sequence.

## Features
- Takes an integer input **N** from the user.
- Prints the first **N** terms of the Fibonacci series.
- Uses simple loops (`for` or `while`) without any additional libraries.
- Ideal for beginners to understand loops and sequences.

## How It Works
- The program initializes the first two Fibonacci numbers, 0 and 1.
- It then uses a loop to calculate subsequent numbers by summing the previous two terms.
- The process continues until **N** terms are printed.
