## Description
This C program counts the number of digits in an integer provided by the user. It uses basic input/output functions and a loop to repeatedly divide the number by 10 until all digits are counted. This is a fundamental programming exercise useful for beginners to understand loops and arithmetic operations.

## Features
- Takes an integer input from the user.
- Uses a loop to count digits by dividing the number repeatedly by 10.
- Handles positive integers and zero correctly.
- Simple and beginner-friendly implementation using only `stdio.h`.

## How It Works
- The program prompts the user to enter an integer.
- It initializes a counter to zero.
- Then, it uses a loop to divide the number by 10 repeatedly, incrementing the counter until the number becomes zero.
- The counter represents the total number of digits.
- Special case: if the input number is zero, the program counts it as one digit.
