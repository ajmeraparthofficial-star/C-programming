# Find Sum of First N Natural Numbers in C

## Author

## Description
This C program calculates the sum of the first N natural numbers using a loop. The program accepts an integer input from the user and iteratively adds numbers from 1 to N to compute the total sum. It uses only the standard input-output library (`stdio.h`) and basic loop constructs, making it a beginner-friendly example of iteration and arithmetic operations in C.

## Features
- Accepts user input for the value of N.
- Uses a `for` loop to calculate the sum of natural numbers from 1 to N.
- Displays the calculated sum with an informative message.
- Simple and easy to understand program structure suitable for beginners.

## How It Works
- The program starts by prompting the user to enter a positive integer N.
- It initializes a variable `sum` to zero.
- Using a `for` loop, it iterates from 1 through N, adding each number to `sum`.
- After completing the loop, it prints the total sum.
