## Description
This C program calculates the sum of the cubes of the first N natural numbers. It prompts the user to enter a positive integer N and then uses a loop to compute the sum of cubes from 1 to N. The program uses only the standard input/output library and basic loops, making it simple and suitable for beginners.

## Features
- Takes user input for the number N.
- Uses a loop to calculate the cube of each number from 1 to N and accumulates the sum.
- Outputs the total sum of cubes.
- Efficient and easy-to-understand logic using basic constructs.

## How It Works
- The program reads an integer N from the user.
- It initializes a `sum` variable to 0.
- Using a `for` loop from 1 to N, it calculates the cube of each number and adds it to the `sum`.
- After the loop completes, the program prints the calculated sum.
