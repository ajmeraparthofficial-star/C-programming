## Description
This simple C program prints the numbers from 1 to 10 using a loop. It demonstrates the use of basic looping constructs and standard input/output functions from `stdio.h`. The program helps beginners understand how iterations work in C.

## Features
- Uses a loop to print numbers sequentially from 1 to 10.
- Utilizes only the `stdio.h` header file.
- Clean and straightforward implementation suitable for beginners.

## How It Works
- The program uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 through 10.
- In each iteration, it prints the current number to the console.
- After printing all numbers, the program ends gracefully.
