# Check Armstrong Number Using Loops in C

## Author

## Description
This C program checks whether a given integer is an Armstrong number using only `stdio.h` and loops. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).

## Features
- Takes integer input from the user.
- Uses loops to calculate the sum of digits raised to the appropriate power.
- Compares the calculated sum with the original number.
- Displays whether the number is Armstrong or not.
- Uses only basic input/output and looping constructs, ideal for beginners.

## How It Works
1. The user enters an integer.
2. The program calculates the number of digits.
3. It computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the total digits using loops.
4. Compares this sum with the original number to check if it is an Armstrong number.
5. Outputs the result accordingly.
