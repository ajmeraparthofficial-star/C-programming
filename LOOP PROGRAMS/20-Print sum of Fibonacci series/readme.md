# Print Sum of Fibonacci Series Using Loops in C

## Author
PARTH AJMERA

## Description
This C program calculates and prints the sum of the Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms using loops. It uses only the standard input/output library (`stdio.h`) and simple loop constructs to generate the series and accumulate the sum.

## Features
- Accepts the number of Fibonacci terms to sum from the user.
- Uses a loop to generate Fibonacci numbers iteratively.
- Calculates and prints the sum of all generated Fibonacci numbers.
- Uses basic C constructs suited for beginners.

## How It Works
- The program initializes the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1).
- Using a loop, it generates subsequent Fibonacci numbers up to the number of terms specified.
- Each Fibonacci number generated is added to a running total.
- Finally, the sum of all generated Fibonacci numbers is displayed.
