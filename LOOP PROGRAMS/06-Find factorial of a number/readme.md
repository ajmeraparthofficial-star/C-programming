# Find Factorial of a Number in C

## Author

## Description
This C program calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer using a loop. It uses only the standard input-output library (`stdio.h`) and basic control structures to compute the factorial efficiently.

## Features
- Prompts the user to enter a non-negative integer.
- Uses a `for` loop to calculate the factorial.
- Handles the factorial of zero (0!) which is defined as 1.
- Prints the calculated factorial value.
- Simple and beginner-friendly implementation.

## How It Works
- The program asks the user to input a number.
- Initializes a factorial result variable to 1.
- Uses a `for` loop starting from 1 up to the input number.
- Multiplies the factorial result by each loop counter value.
- After the loop ends, prints the final factorial value.
