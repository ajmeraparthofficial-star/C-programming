# Print Odd Numbers from 1 to 100 in C

## Author

## Description
This C program prints all odd numbers from 1 to 100 using simple loops and the standard input-output library `stdio.h`. It demonstrates the use of a `for` loop to iterate through a range and conditional logic to identify and print odd numbers.

## Features
- Uses only the `stdio.h` library.
- Efficiently prints odd numbers from 1 to 100.
- Uses loops to avoid manual printing.
- Simple code ideal for beginners learning loops and conditional statements.

## How It Works
- The program runs a loop from 1 to 100.
- Inside the loop, it checks if a number is odd by testing if the remainder when divided by 2 is not zero (`i % 2 != 0`).
- If the condition is true, the number is printed.
- This repeats until the loop completes.
