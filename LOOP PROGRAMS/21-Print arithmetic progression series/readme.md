# Print Arithmetic Progression (A.P.) Series Using Loops in C

## Author

## Description
This program prints the arithmetic progression (A.P.) series based on user inputs using loops in C. The arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers in which the difference of any two successive members is a constant called the common difference.

The program uses only the standard input/output library (`stdio.h`) and loop constructs (`for` or `while`) to generate and display the series.

## Features
- Takes the first term, number of terms, and common difference as input from the user.
- Uses loop constructs to calculate and print each term in the arithmetic progression.
- Simple, clear logic suitable for beginners learning loops and series in C.

## How It Works
1. The user is prompted to enter:
   - The first term of the series.
   - The total number of terms to print.
   - The common difference between terms.
2. The program uses a loop to compute each term by adding the common difference to the previous term.
3. Each term is printed until the specified number of terms is reached.
