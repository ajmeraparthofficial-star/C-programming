# Print Geometric Progression Series Using Loops

## Author
PARTH AJMERA

## Description
This C program prints the terms of a geometric progression (GP) series using loops. The program prompts the user to input the first term, the total number of terms, and the common ratio. It then calculates and displays the GP series by multiplying the previous term by the common ratio in each iteration.

The program uses only the standard input-output library (`stdio.h`) and loop constructs, making it simple and beginner-friendly.

## Features
- Takes user input for the first term, number of terms, and common ratio.
- Uses a loop to generate and print all terms in the GP series.
- No additional libraries or functions are used other than `stdio.h`.
- Clear and logical flow suitable for beginners learning loops and series.

## How It Works
- The program initializes the first term as the starting value.
- Using a `for` loop, each subsequent term is generated by multiplying the current term by the common ratio.
- Each term is printed in sequence until the total number of terms is reached.
