## Description
This simple C program prints numbers from 10 down to 1 using a loop. It uses only the standard input/output library (`stdio.h`) and a for loop to display the numbers in descending order. This program is ideal for beginners learning loops and basic output in C.

## Features
- Prints numbers from 10 to 1 sequentially.
- Uses `for` loop for iteration.
- Demonstrates basic use of standard I/O functions.
- Clear and easy-to-understand code suitable for beginners.

## How It Works
- The program initializes a loop variable starting at 10.
- The loop decrements this variable by 1 each iteration until it reaches 1.
- In each iteration, it prints the current number followed by a space.
