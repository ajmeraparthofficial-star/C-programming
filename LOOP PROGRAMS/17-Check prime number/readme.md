# Check Prime Number Using Loops in C

## Author

## Description
This C program checks whether a given number is a prime number using loops. It prompts the user to enter an integer and then determines if the number is prime by checking divisibility using a `for` loop. The program only uses the standard input/output library (`stdio.h`) and basic control flow with loops, making it an ideal example for beginners learning about loops and conditional statements in C.

## Features
- Takes input from the user.
- Uses a loop to check if the number is divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself.
- Prints whether the number is prime or not.
- Simple and beginner-friendly implementation.

## How It Works
- The program asks the user to input an integer.
- It checks divisibility from 2 up to half of the number using a `for` loop.
- If the number is divisible by any of these, it is not prime.
- If no divisors are found, the number is prime.
- Special cases like 1 and numbers less than 1 are handled appropriately.
