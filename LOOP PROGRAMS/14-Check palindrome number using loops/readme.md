# Check Palindrome Number Using Loops in C

## Author

## Description
This C program checks whether a given integer number is a palindrome. A palindrome number reads the same backward as forward, such as 121 or 1331. The program uses loops and basic logic with standard input/output functions from `stdio.h` to determine if the number is a palindrome.

## Features
- Accepts an integer input from the user.
- Uses loops to reverse the number.
- Compares the original number with its reverse.
- Displays whether the number is a palindrome or not.
- Uses only `stdio.h` and loops for simplicity.
- Easy to understand and suitable for beginners.

## How It Works
- The user is prompted to enter a number.
- The program stores the original number.
- A loop extracts digits from the number and constructs the reversed number.
- After the loop ends, the original number and reversed number are compared.
- If they match, the number is a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.
