## Description
This C program takes three numbers as input from the user and determines the largest among them. It demonstrates the use of basic input/output functions and conditional statements to compare values.

## Features
- Prompts the user to enter three integers.
- Compares the numbers using nested `if-else` statements.
- Displays the largest number.
- Simple, effective logic suitable for beginners learning decision-making in C.

## How It Works
- The program uses `printf` to request three numbers from the user.
- It reads the input using `scanf`.
- Then, it compares the three numbers with conditional statements:
  - First, it compares the first two numbers.
  - Then compares the larger one with the third number.
- Finally, it prints the largest number.
