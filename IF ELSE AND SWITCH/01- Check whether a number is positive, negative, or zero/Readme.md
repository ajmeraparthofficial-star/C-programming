## Description
This program checks whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero. It takes an integer input from the user and uses simple conditional statements (`if-else`) to determine and display the sign of the number.

## Features
- Prompts the user to enter an integer.
- Evaluates if the number is positive, negative, or zero.
- Displays the result with an appropriate message.
- Simple and easy to understand logic for beginners.

## How It Works
The program reads the number entered by the user and:
- If the number is greater than zero, prints "Positive number".
- If the number is less than zero, prints "Negative number".
- If the number is zero, prints "The number is zero".
