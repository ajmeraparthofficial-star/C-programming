# Check Whether a Character is a Vowel or Consonant

## Description
This C program determines whether an input character is a vowel or a consonant. It prompts the user to enter a single alphabet character and uses conditional statements to check for both uppercase and lowercase vowels. The program then prints whether the character is a vowel or consonant. It also handles non-alphabet inputs gracefully.

## Features
- Accepts a single character input from the user.
- Checks for vowels (both uppercase and lowercase).
- Distinguishes consonants from vowels.
- Prints a message for non-alphabetic characters.
- Simple and easy-to-understand implementation suitable for beginners.

## How It Works
- The program reads a character from the user.
- It checks if the character matches any vowel characters: `a, e, i, o, u` or their uppercase equivalents.
- If a match is found, it prints that the character is a vowel.
- If the input is an alphabet but not a vowel, it prints the character is a consonant.
- If the input is not an alphabet, it notifies the user accordingly.
